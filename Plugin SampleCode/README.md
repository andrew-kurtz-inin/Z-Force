**Sample Component Plugins and Test Classes**
--

**Introduction**
--

Use the sample codes in this section to implement sample custom component plugins and to test those custom plugins.

Zuora Support does not troubleshoot content from GitHub. The sample code is as an example of code 
that has worked for previous implementations and was created by both Zuora and non-Zuora authors. 

**Instructions**
--
To create a sample plugin:

1. In Salesforce, add a new class using the plugin code in this section.
2. Register the sample plugin as described in [Component Registration](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/CA_Commerce/C_Zuora_Quotes/G_Zuora_Quotes_Configuration_Settings/O_Component_Registration).

To test the sample plugin:

1. Create a sample plugin as described above.
2. Add a new test class using the test class code in this section.
