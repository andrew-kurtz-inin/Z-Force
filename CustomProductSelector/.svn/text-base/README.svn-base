Zuora Z-Force Sample Code Package: Custom Product Selector with Filtering

INTRODUCTION
------------

This Z-Force Sample Code Package provides a reference implementation of a custom Product Selector with filtering capabilities, built using Global Methods and Components. 

PRE-REQUISITES
-------------

1. This sample code package is an unmanaged package that depends on the following Z-Force managed packages: 
- Z-Force 360 Version 2.2
- Z-Force Quotes Version 5.3

2. If you do not have Force.com Migration Tool already installed, please follow the instructions below: 

1). Visit http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp and install Java JDK, Version 6.1 or greater on the deployment machine.
2). Visit http://ant.apache.org/ and install Apache Ant, Version 1.6 or greater on the deployment machine.
3). Set up the environment variables (such as ANT_HOME, JAVA_HOME, and PATH) as specified in the Ant Installation Guide at http://ant.apache.org/manual/install.html.
4). Log in to Salesforce on your deployment machine. Click Your Name | Setup | Develop | Tools, then click Force.com Migration Tool.
5). Unzip the downloaded file to the directory of your choice. The Zip file contains a Jar file containing the ant tasks: ant-salesforce.jar
6). Copy the ant-salesforce.jar file from the unzipped file into the ant lib directly.  The ant lib directly is located in the root folder of your Ant installation. 

INSTALLATION-INSTRUCTIONS
-------------------------

1. Open build.properties, and specify the login credentials for your Salesforce.com organization: 

sf.username=
sf.password= 

Please note that the password should be your login password concatenated with the security token.

2. Navigate to Z-Force/CustomProductSelector folder, and type: 
ant deploy

This will deploy the sample code unmanaged package into your Salesforce.com organization.  

PACKAGE CONTENTS 
================

1. Custom Fields
This package includes the following 2 custom fields
(1) zqu__ZProduct__c.Current_Product__c: A pick list field indicating whether the product is a current product.  Possible values are Yes and No.
(2) zqu__ProductRatePlan__c.Region__c: A pick list field containing the region values, Possible values include US East, US West and US Central.

2. Custom Button: Select Products with Filter
This is a custom button that can be configured onto the Quote Layout.  It launches a VisualForce page CustomProductSelector that displays a Product Selector page, with the following filtering on Products and Rate Plans applied: 
zqu__ZProduct__c.Current_Product__c = 'Yes'
zqu__ProductRatePlan__c.Region__c = 'US East'

The key filtering implementation is in CustomProductSelector Apex class.  As a developer you can specify a different filter criteria in the following constants that satisfy your own business requirements: 

  /**
   * Set up the Custom Product Filter.  In this example, there is a custom field Current_Product__c created on the ZProduct__c object:
   * Type: Picklist
   * Values: Yes, No
   * 
   * We will only show the products with Current_Product__c == 'Yes'
   */
  static final String PRODUCT_FILTER_SOQL_SEGMENT = ' AND Current_Product__c = \'Yes\' ';
  
  /**
   * Set up the Custom Rate Plan Filter.  In this example, there is a custom field Region__c created on the Product_Rate_Plan__c object: 
   * Type: Picklist
   * Values: US West, US East, US Central. 
   *
   * We will only show the products with Region__c = 'US West'. 
   */
  static final String RATEPLAN_FILTER_SOQL_SEGMENT = ' AND Region__c = \'US East\' ';
