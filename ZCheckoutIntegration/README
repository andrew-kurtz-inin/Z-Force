Zuora Z-Force Sample Code Package: Zuora Z-Checkout and Salesforce.com Integration Sample

INTRODUCTION
------------

This sample implementation of Z-Checkout pages in Salesforce.com contains the following 3 scenarios: 
(1) Create a payment method from a Billing Account detail page 
(2) Create a payment method from Quote detail page that is associated with the quote that has been sent to Z-Billing. 
(3) Create a subscription from a particular rate plan through Z-Checkout page

The newly created payment method will be set as the default payment method of the associated billing account, and "Auto-Pay" will be enabled for the associated billing account.  
The default payment method and the Auto-Pay information will be available on the Billing Account record in SFDC after the next SFDC Sync is run.
