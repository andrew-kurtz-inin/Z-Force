This Z-Force Sample Code package provides a reference implementation that allows product bundling capability.  

In this sample application, a Product Bundle contains one or more Product Rate Plans from different ZProducts. 
An end-user can add a product bundle to a quote.  Upon saving, all the rate plans associated with the product bundle
will be added to the quote together.
