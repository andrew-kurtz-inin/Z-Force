The sample code is as an example of code \r\nthat has worked for previous implementations and was created by both Zuora and non-Zuora authors. \r\nPlease send any GitHub-related comments and feedback to Dev-Support@zuora.\r\n\r\n**Pre-Requisites**\r\n--\r\n\r\nThe Z-Force Sample Code Suite includes a set of unmanaged packages that depend on the following Z-Force managed packages:\r\n  * Z-Force 360 Version 2.2 or above\r\n  * Z-Force Quotes Version 5.3 or above\r\n\r\n**Order Builder Sample Code**\r\nThis Z-Force Sample Code package provides a reference implementation of creating amendment using Z-Force Order Builder Apex Components.\r\n\r\n**Custom Product Selector**\r\n--\r\nCustom Product Selector sample code package provides a reference implementation of a custom Product Selector with filtering and searching capabilities, built using Global Methods and Components.\r\n\r\n**Z-Checkout Integration**\r\n--\r\n\r\nThis sample implementation of Z-Checkout pages in Salesforce.com contains the following 3 scenarios: \r\n(1) Create a payment method from a Billing Account detail page \r\n(2) Create a payment method from Quote detail page that is associated with the quote that has been sent to Z-Billing. \r\n(3) Create a subscription from a particular rate plan through Z-Checkout page\r\n\r\nThe newly created payment method will be set as the default payment method of the associated billing account, and \"Auto-Pay\" will be enabled for the associated billing account. \r\n \r\nThe default payment method and the Auto-Pay information will be available on the Billing Account record in SFDC after the next SFDC Sync is run.\r\n\r\n**Product Bundling**\r\n--\r\nThis Z-Force Sample Code package provides a reference implementation that allows product bundling capability.  \r\n\r\nIn this sample application, a Product Bundle contains one or more Product Rate Plans from different ZProducts.
