{"google":"ZForce Sample Code","tagline":"Zuora ZCommerce","body":"**Introduction**\r\n--\r\n\r\nThe **Z-Force Sample Code Suite** provides executable code examples in unmanaged Force.com packages. \r\n\r\nZuora Support does not troubleshoot content from GitHub. The sample code is as an example of code \r\nthat has worked for previous implementations and was created by both Zuora and non-Zuora authors. \r\nPlease send any GitHub-related comments and feedback to Dev-Support@zuora.\r\n\r\n**Prerequisites**\r\n--\r\n\r\nThe **Z-Force Sample Code Suite** contains a set of unmanaged packages that depend on the following Z-Force managed packages:\r\n  * _Z-Force 360 Version 2.2_ or above\r\n  * _Z-Force Quotes Version 5.3_ or above\r\n\r\n**Amendment Quote Validator**\r\n--\r\nThis package provides a reference implementation to validate whether the Amendment Quote is amending on a subscription that has been renewed at Zuora. If the subscription is already renewed it will provide an option to the end user to create an amendment on the latest version of the subscription.\r\n\r\n**Custom Product Selector**\r\n--\r\nThis sample code package provides a reference implementation of a custom Product Selector with filtering and searching capabilities, built using Zuora Development Kit.\r\n\r\n**Order Builder Sample Code Suite**\r\n--\r\nThe Order Builder Sample Code Suite contains a series of sample code packages that provide reference implementations of using Z-Force Order Builder Component Library.\r\n\r\n**Product Bundling**\r\n--\r\nThis package provides a reference implementation that allows product bundling capability.  \r\n\r\nIn this sample application, a Product Bundle contains one or more Product Rate Plans from different ZProducts. An end-user can add a product bundle to a quote.  Upon saving, all the rate plans associated with the product bundle will be added to the quote together.\r\n\r\n**Quote Split**\r\n--\r\nThis package provides a reference implementation that sends a quote to Zuora to create 2 subscriptions.\r\n\r\n**Quote-to-Payment Processing Custom Trigger** \r\n--\r\nThis package provides a reference implementation of the BeforeInsert Trigger on \"Quote Processing Data\" object, which is part of Z-Force Quotes feature \"Mass Quote-to-Payment Processing\".\r\n\r\n**Subscription Charges Updater**\r\n--\r\nThis package provides a reference implementation that allows batch-update of a set of subscription charges, as well as the term conditions of their related subscriptions.\r\n\r\n**Z-Checkout Integration**\r\n--\r\nThis sample implementation of integrating Z-Checkout pages with Force.com contains reference implementations of the following 3 functionalities: \r\n  * Ability to create a payment method from a Billing Account detail page \r\n  * Ability to create a payment method from Quote detail page that is associated with the quote that has been sent to Z-Billing. \r\n  * Ability to create a subscription from a particular rate plan through Z-Checkout page\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","note":"Don't delete this file!
